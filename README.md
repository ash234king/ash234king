## 🚀 About Me

I’m a passionate Machine Learning developer with strong foundations in **Deep Learning, Generative AI, NLP**, and real-world **MLOps + Deployment**.  
Along with ML, I actively practice **DSA** (488 LeetCode questions and a 1650 leetcode rating, Codeforces), and focus on building impactful, scalable AI systems.

Currently, I'm pursuing advanced upskilling in **Generative AI, LangChain, LLMs, and Hugging Face**, with a goal to build industry-ready AI applications.
